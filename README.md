# Sales Analysis and Data Exploration Project

This project is focused on exploring, analyzing, and interpreting the sales data of a hypothetical company. It uses Python programming language and several libraries for data analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python, you can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/. The project is developed in Python 3.8, but it should work in other Python 3 versions as well.

In addition to Python, the project uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib


You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib 
```

### Installing

To install the project, simply clone it from the git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhilakkala/sales-analysis.git
```
### Project Structure

Here's the basic structure of the project:

- `Monthly_Sales_Files/`: Contains the data files for the project.
- `Sales_Analysis.ipynb`: Contains Python data analysis and data exploration.
- `clean-data(output)/`: Stores output file clean and processed data and results.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.

### Usage

To run the project, navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and start a Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook
```

You can then open the notebook files (`.ipynb`) and run the cells to perform data analysis.
